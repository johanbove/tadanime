# Tadanime

Tadanime is a proof of concept of a decentralized anime rating Web application.
It makes use of Linked Open Data to display information of the anime to the user.
It uses a user's Solid POD to get the user's ratings of anime.
Thus, no server-side logic is required for the application
as both the information about the anime and the personal information of the user
is stored on different servers.

## Used technologies/concepts

- [Linked Open Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html): get details of anime ([Between Our Worlds](https://betweenourworlds.org))
